#### Data Engineering

* Using the information a table schema was created from the employee data. All data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints were identified.

* All tables were created in the correct order to handle foreign keys.

* All employee data was imported in the same order that the tables were created and all headers were accounted for to avoid errors.
